Executable Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization kernel for `hex-gram-schmidt`.

This module is the rational core that the rest of the library builds on. It
defines the projection primitives (`projectionCoeff`, `subtractProjection`),
the per-row reduction `reduceAgainstBasis`, the left-to-right orthogonalization
`basisRows`/`basisMatrix`, the coefficient matrix `coeffMatrix`, and the
supporting entry/prefix helpers (`entry`, `castIntMatrix`, `prefixCombination`,
`prefixRows`, `prefixSpan`). It also proves the foundational facts the
correspondence proofs consume: pairwise orthogonality of `basisRows`, the
residual/projection reconstruction identity, the leading-row equation, and the
zero-norm degeneracy lemmas (a `Rat` vector with zero self-dot-product is the
zero vector).
