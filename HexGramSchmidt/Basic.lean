Core Gram-Schmidt basis and coefficient definitions for `hex-gram-schmidt`.

This module provides executable Gram-Schmidt basis and coefficient
constructions over the dense `Hex.Matrix` representation. Integer inputs are
cast to rationals before applying Gram-Schmidt; rational inputs operate
directly on the ambient matrix. It also states the structural theorems used by
downstream lattice and reduction code, including the prefix-span invariance
surface consumed by later LLL work.
